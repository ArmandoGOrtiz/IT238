    <p>Back in 2000, we started out with one small location and one big goal&hellip;to serve delicious Mexican food made from fresh ingredients and cooked in our own home-style tradition. And while we were not an overnight success, we believe it was our hard work and dedication to our customers that helped us to accomplish our goal and then some. When our doors first opened more than 19 years ago, there were no cell phones, no internet, no such thing as Facebook and twitter was bird talk! A lot has changed since 1949 and we&rsquo;ve come a long way from that little stand at Main Street. We branched out into catering and as we've grown, we've embraced technology in our kitchens, our buildings and, of course, our offices. We&rsquo;re available to you most any time of day or night and you have a choice of locations throughout the city Z area. Thanks for being part of the MRX journey and BTW, don&rsquo;t forget to like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p>

    <p>At MRX, we go above and beyond to put our customers first. From our recipes to our catering, from our hours of operation to our sales, everything is carefully thought out with our customers in mind. We serve fresh, quality food at reasonable prices and we serve it fast for easy carry out or for dining in. We're open 7 days a week, 365 days a year open early morning for breakfast, late night for the after-hours set and several of our locations are open 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Our customers can also expect and look forward to saving with our daily and monthly specials. Our marketing group sends out additional specials through the mail and our Facebook fans and Twitter followers can always get a great deal just by keeping an eye on us. Not a part of social media? No worries, you can sign up to join our {e-mail club} for exclusive specials.

    <p>In addition to great food, we serve our customers better with state-of-the-art innovations that also benefit the environment. All of our kitchens operate with the most efficient equipment in the restaurant industry. We also strive to be green outside of the kitchen, too. </p>
<p>When we were constructing our Side Street and Other Boulevard location, home to our main kitchen and headquarters, we installed solar panels making us the first restaurant in the country to incorporate solar energy to directly heat our water. The panels allow for the use of a natural resource that is renewable, affordable and maintenance free. As you know, solar energy is also pollution-free, doesn&rsquo;t cause global warming and, more importantly, reduces our dependence on foreign energy. We're also using energy-efficient tankless water heaters that help us waste less water and eliminate standby losses - energy that's wasted when hot water cools down in long pipes or while it's sitting in the storage tank.</p>
<p>At both our Main Street &amp; and Side Street locations, we paved our parking lots with permeable pavers. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface and help the environment by allowing water, such as storm water or melted snow, to filter through the surface and drain into the underlying soil. This drainage keeps water pollutants out of our natural waterways, which protects the quality of our water supplies. Just another way we&rsquo;re utilizing a natural resource and helping our environment!</p>
<p>We also have an extensive recycling program, use Energy Star appliances, energy-efficient lighting, radiant heat, high-efficiency HVAC units and we drive diesel fuel delivery trucks. Some of diesel fuel's environmental advantages are better mileage for diesel engines vs. traditional gasoline engines and that less refining is required for diesel fuel. </p>
<p>And new to our site, you can now order MRX gear featuring
  Hanes EcoSmart&reg; shirts are made with up to 5% polyester created from recycled plastic bottles. </p>
<p>Wherever we can, we reduce, reuse, recycle, replenish and restore!</p>
